# QtMVT: Model/View templates for Qt
(Currently only one model template)

This project intends to provide class templates to use in conjunction with
Qt's Model/View Delegate system. QtMVT intends to offer the following
advantages over normal Model/View Delegate usage:

* No need to subclass QAbstract*Model classes for custom element types
* Less boilerplate and less work to setup a model

## Requirements
* Qt > 5.0
* gcc > 4.9.**2** (Do **not** use 4.9.1, it has a bug that makes the compilation fail)

This project is still very small. I'm not working a lot on it because I'm
stuck in some design decisions and my paid work and other projects take a lot
of time.
